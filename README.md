## 📚 About  
This project aims to create a **Solidity-based smart contract system** for the educational sector.  
The idea is to allow **universities and schools** to issue **diplomas, transcripts, and course exemptions** directly on the blockchain.  

With **soulbound certificates** (non-transferable NFTs), students could keep a **secure and permanent record** of their academic history in their wallet.  
Institutions and employers would be able to **verify these credentials in a transparent way**, reducing paperwork and preventing fraud.  

## 🛠️ Tech I plan to use  
- **Solidity** ^0.8.x  
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts** (AccessControl, ERC721)  
- **Hardhat** for testing and deployment  
- **IPFS** for certificate metadata storage
